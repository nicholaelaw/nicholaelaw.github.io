title: Blogging Mishap

Well, I was right on the WordPress app on iPad needs additional works. I just found out instead of making a new post for that iPad with USB keyboard article, it edited and replaced my Saturday’s Endeavour post! Which is super-not-cool.

I thought I just lost the first super boring super long post. Heartbreaking! Fortunately WordPress.com has a post revision module! Only thing is, it’s hidden from view by default. In order to make it appear, click the “screen option” when in post editing page, and check the “revision” box.

<div class="imgDisplayS" style="max-width: 600px;" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageGallery">
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <a href="/assets/old/blogging-mishap-844x301.png" itemprop="contentUrl" data-size="844x301" >
    <img src="/assets/old/blogging-mishap-844x301.png" itemprop="thumbnail" 
      title="I'm sorry I had to leave you, Wordpress. It just kinda happened." 
      alt="I'm sorry I had to leave you, Wordpress. It just kinda happened." />
    </a>
    <figcaption itemprop="caption description">I'm sorry I had to leave you, Wordpress. It just kinda happened.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

Just like that, my post got resurrected. Though I’m not using that app again any time soon. I think it is appropriate to add this at the end: WTF?!

{% include pswpRoot.html %}
