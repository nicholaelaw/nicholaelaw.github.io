title: May 2010 Refresh

It’s been goddamn too long since the last update. I don’t even remember what I wrote last time I was here. Well it’s not like I am legally obligated to update my blog, but here we go.

We went to the Rockies last week. I took quite a few pictures as usual, and some nice ones too. Here’s a few panoramas I stitched together (more precisely Photoshop did it; I’m just a human pushing buttons):

<div class="imgDisplay monod" style="max-width: 600px;" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageGallery">
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <a href="/assets/old/UnknownPanoTrim30-1024x358.jpg" itemprop="contentUrl" data-size="1024x358" >
    <img src="/assets/old/UnknownPanoTrim30-600x209.jpg" itemprop="thumbnail" 
      title="It's really just the side of the road. On a mountain." 
      alt="It's really just the side of the road. On a mountain." />
    </a>

This  was taken somewhere on the road, during a bathroom break. Now another one:

<div class="imgDisplay monod" style="max-width: 600px;" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageGallery">
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">

      alt="Lots of ice. Ice everywhere." />
    </a>

This is Emerald Lake, which is just starting to thaw. Quite disappointing.

This is their prized Lake Louise. I heard it’s one of the most beautiful lakes in the world. Too bad it’s still frozen.

<div class="imgDisplay monod" style="max-width: 600px;" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageGallery">
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">

This one was taken at the Gondola station at Banff. We didn’t ride the Gondola, but we have wait for others that did.

So this is it. Pretty mediocre you think? I didn’t bother adjust all the levels and whatnot, mainly because I don’t know how. But don’t walk away just yet. I still have a few (arguably better) ones to show:

<div class="imgDisplay monod" style="max-width: 486px;" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageGallery">
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">

      alt="OUT OF THE BLUE, NOW." />
    </a>
    <figcaption itemprop="caption description">OUT OF THE BLUE, NOW.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

Taken at the Natural Bridge. The actual bridge isn’t in this photo. I was looking away from the bridge when taking this. The water is pretty nice, and from what I’ve been told, it’s not CuCl<sub>2 </sub>or CuSO<sub>4 </sub>doing the color thing. Well, not that I expected it to be anyway. Next:

<div class="imgDisplay monod" style="max-width: 600px;" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageGallery">
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">

      title="That mountain looks like it's in agony. We should put it down." 
      alt="That mountain looks like it's in agony. We should put it down." />
    </a>

This is my personal favorite from this trip. The natural bridge is a close second. This was taken at the Columbia Ice Field. Mountains, snow and glaciers, how very delicious. It was actually blazing hot when we were up there, and we had to take our jackets off because of it. My theory is that most of the heat from the sun is reflected from the snow to us, since humans and their clothes are in a deeper color than crystallized water. Anyway, I just want to say the picture does not reflect the actual weather when it was taken. It was quite bright. Pity I only have a SONY W200 point-and-shoot. Imagine taking this with a 5D Mk II on a GigaPan, and then do an HDR merge! At least I can dream.

Now you have seen them. My panoramas. Anyone feeling like having the pictures in original resolution can contact me and I’ll try sending one.

Next I’m gonna post a few other pictures from a recent trip to the Stanley Park. The Beaver Lake (or Beaver’s Lake, I really can’t decide):

Vancouver’s in a very good weather these days. Everything is so…light up. Walking back we looked at some harbor in North Vancouver (across the sea):

This time I did some lighting adjustments in Viveza. Nothing dramatic, just to get a consistent brightness. I love the clear sky, but it also feels so empty.

That’s the main course in this update. I hope they taste good. Now let’s talk about something else.

I’m finally, definitively graduating this year. I’m leaving Vancouver. To where? Well if you are reading this I’d assume you already know one way or another. I (still) have almost no life outside the computer, I am running out of toilet papers and oh, I gotta pee.

Ok, I’m not the greatest story teller. You can tell because I’m a Math major. Right now it’s 12:29PM, May 15, 2010. The weather is good and I’m not hungry. I’m going to Victoria tomorrow, yes another trip. More pictures you can expect. Talking like Yoda I feel like. Nothing more to report I have. Just one more picture to end this ranting.
